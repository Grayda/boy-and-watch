# boy-and-watch

This repo contains image files and information regarding the "Boy & Watch" watch face I've published on Facer.

The published watch face can be found [here](https://www.facer.io/watchface/yQiAQz2n6j)

The icons are hand-made using the [8-bit icon drawer](https://apollowayne.me/8bit-Icon-Drawer/index.html). The heart is my own creation, the boot is inspired by the pegasus shoes in The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening (because drawing 16x16 icons that look like things is tough!). You'll need Photoshop or a compatible program to open the PSD file. The fonts used are:

* Gill Sans for the "Dot Matrix" text
* Early Gameboy for the clock, date, steps and heart rate
* G.B.Boot for the weather

Pull requests welcomed, issues welcomed (but I only have a Pixel Watch to test on)
