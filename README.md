# retro-watchfaces

This repo contains image files and information regarding the various watchfaces I've published on Facer.

You can view the faces [here](https://www.facer.io/user/74rwbwHC21)

Each one was hand-created in SVG, with VS Code as the IDE and the jock.svg extension for previewing. Some require additional fonts, so see the notes below:

## boy-and-watch

This is a DMG-01 themed watch, available in square and round configurations and can be found [here](https://www.facer.io/watchface/yQiAQz2n6j)

You'll need three fonts to recreate this:

* `Gill Sans` for the "Dot Matrix" text
* `Early Gameboy` for the clock, date, steps and heart rate
* `G.B.Boot` for the weather

The icons are hand-made using the [8-bit icon drawer](https://apollowayne.me/8bit-Icon-Drawer/index.html). The heart is my own creation, the boot is inspired by the pegasus shoes in The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening (because drawing 16x16 icons that look like things is tough!). 

## watch-advance

A Game Boy Advance themed watch that can be found [here](https://www.facer.io/watchface/txlxlYrOWr)

You'll need three fonts to recreate this:

* `Futura MD BT` for the "WATCHBOY" text
* `Gamecuben Dualset Regular` for the "ADVANCE" text
* `Atlantis International` for all the text in the watch face

## swatch

A Nintendo Switch themed watch. Requires no fonts. This design uses a lot of variables to make things easy to change (e.g. the joycon width). NOTE: Be careful when uploading this to Facer, as it'll get removed automatically

Pull requests welcomed, issues welcomed (but I only have a Pixel Watch to test on)
